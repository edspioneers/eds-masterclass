rebuilding it from scratch to be a more flexible, powerful, and simpler hosting
platform. You might have seen us making some noise about this in
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/deno.land" rel="noopener noreferrer">social</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/deno_land" rel="noopener noreferrer">media</a> over the last few months.</p>
<p>We ran an early access program with the community testing it out and giving
valuable feedback to help us make this huge update possible.</p>
<p>Now, this updated version of Deno Deploy is available to all, and I wanted to
call out just a few of the reasons I’m excited about this update.</p>
<p>I’m no stranger to hosting and development platforms. I spent 7 years working at
Netlify while they were defining big parts of the modern web hosting category
and establishing many of the conventions and tools that developers now consider
essential for web development projects. Those perspectives only add to my
enthusiasm for the road ahead for Deno with Deploy.</p>
<h2 id="integrated-cicd">Integrated CI/CD</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> You now have the option to run your builds within Deno Deploy, or
on your own CI/CD</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the old Deno Deploy (still available as “Deploy Classic”) deploys happened by
performing a build in your own system and then pushing that result to Deno
Deploy. That might have been from your own CI/CD system or GitHub Actions. This
option is still available, but now we also offer an optimized, high performance,
integrated build environment to do this for you.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="http://localhost:3001/blog/deno-deploy-highlights/builds-panel.webp" alt="Builds listing page">
  <figcaption>The list of recent builds in Deno Deploy’s console</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our build pipeline offers great visibility into the deployment process and your
automated builds. Just connect a GitHub repo to your application and off you go.</p>
<p>Naturally, this comes along with the ability to perform branch-deploys, preview
builds, rollbacks, and all that good stuff that it would be hard to imagine
working without these days.</p>
<p>This sort of feature has been available in other popular hosting platforms for a
while, so it might not feel like news. But Deno Deploy also offers interesting
controls over the hosting model, with ready-made optimisations for static or
dynamic applications, and autodetection and optimisations for popular tools and
frameworks.</p>
<p>Now you don’t have to choose between a simple and integrated CI/CD setup, and
some of the more advanced architectural controls that we’re introducing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Quickly start with KV then easily graduate to a full database when

<p>Manageable access to, and admin of data services is often one of the first
headaches when sites and applications increase in complexity. We wanted to
simplify that.</p>
<p>Together, <a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Deno runtime</a> and Deno Deploy
offer simple access to reading and writing data to persistent storage via
<a href="/kv" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno KV</a>, our popular KV store.</p>
<p>With surprisingly little code, you can begin managing data in a persistent data
store:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Deploy organises your databases to prevent data pollution between

</blockquote>
<p>We’ve made it simple
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/reference/databases/#getting-started" rel="noopener noreferrer">to link and provision databases</a>
from third-party database providers to your applications in ways that make sense
for how developers work with code.</p>
<p>Our database integrations do some work behind the scenes to create database
instances for each of your development and production contexts. That means that
you can provision or allocate a database to one of your applications, and
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/reference/databases/#connecting-an-app-to-a-database" rel="noopener noreferrer">get
separate databases for each environment</a>.</p>
<p>It’s very helpful to know that the data in your development or staging
environments will not pollute the data in your production environment. Deno
Deploy just handles that for you. I love it!</p>
<p>This also means that your application code can remain the same in all contexts.
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/reference/databases/#automatic-environment-variables" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environment variables managed automatically</a>

  <figcaption>We can review the available databases and explore them with the DB explorer </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ve partnered with Prisma to provision new databases for free. Again, all from
the Deno Deploy console. It’s an incredibly convenient way of adding databases
to your applications.</p>
<p>We even have
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/reference/databases/#migration-and-schema-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">tooling for schema migrations</a>

<h3 id="see-your-data">See your data</h3>
<p>It’s also simple to visualize your data right there in the Deno Deploy console.
The database explorer lets you poke around and query your data, across any of
the contexts where your databases live.</p>

<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> All apps get useful data and analytics, out of the box</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of data, Deno Deploy surfaces a variety of metrics and analytics for
every application. You don’t need to do anything to enable this beyond deploying
your application.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="http://localhost:3001/blog/deno-deploy-highlights/metrics.webp" alt="Metrics overview">
  <figcaption>Excerpt of the metrics summary for an application</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Deploy’s metrics are easy to explore with the interactive charting and a variety
of presets and custom timeframes.</p>
<p>I also like getting access to the automatic 404 logging. The concise little 404
report which groups the 404s by path and orders them by frequency is very handy
for catching routes that need handling.</p>
<figure class="sm:w-2/3 md:w-1/2 mx-auto">
  <img src="http://localhost:3001/blog/deno-deploy-highlights/404-panel.webp" alt="404 panel">
  <figcaption>The 404 report can be filtered and have its reporting timeframe adjusted</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Whether you are serving a static site or a dynamic app, there are useful metrics
available here, including CPU time, memory usage, V8 garbage collection time,
and allocated heap size.</p>
<p>Find all of these in the console for your applications.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-observability-with-otel">Automatic observability with OTel</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Easily observe and instrument your code with built-in support for
OpenTelemetry</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more complex and critical applications, rich telemetry is vital. The
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/open_telemetry/" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in support for OpenTelemetry</a>
makes it simple for developers to observe what is happening in their
applications.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="http://localhost:3001/blog/deno-deploy-highlights/traces.webp" alt="application traces">
  <figcaption>Logs, traces, and metrics are built in</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Any project hosted on Deno Deploy (even if there isn’t specific telemetry
instrumentation code) will automatically show logs, traces, and metrics in the
application console. But you can go further by connecting these to your own OTel
service along with whatever additional instrumentation you specify in your code.</p>
<p>We shipped support for
<a href="/blog/v2.2#built-in-opentelemetry-integration" rel="noopener noreferrer">auto-instrumented observability and telemetry in Deno 2.2</a>,
and by hosting your project in Deno Deploy, the job of connecting your
application to a tool like Grafana becomes very straight forward.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="http://localhost:3001/blog/deno-deploy-highlights/otel1.webp" alt="Telemetry data">

<p>There is
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/open_telemetry/#auto-instrumentation" rel="noopener noreferrer">auto-instrumentation</a>
associated with incoming and outgoing HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Our examples have a number of
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/examples/#opentelemetry" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorials on OTel</a> to explore,
including:</p>

<h2 id="application-settings-and-env-vars">Application settings and env vars</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> You can tune the infrastructure for your applications and manage
things centrally</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When creating a new application, you can choose to tune it as a dynamic app or a
static site. This will shape the server configuration and caching behaviours
with some sensible defaults.</p>

  <img src="http://localhost:3001/blog/deno-deploy-highlights/runtime-config.webp" alt="Runtime config">
  <figcaption>Optimizing the runtime to serve a dynamic or a static app</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I really like this control. I’m a big advocate in keeping projects as simple as
possible, so being able to serve static files and add server logic only when
needed, all in one product, feels like a huge win.</p>
<p>You can also
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/reference/env_vars_and_contexts/#adding%2C-editing-and-removing-environment-variables" rel="noopener noreferrer">manage environment variables and secrets</a>
at an application level, and at the org level to help share them across all the
applications in your organisation.</p>
<p>You’ll find controls in the console to manage these along with the ability to
import the contents of a <code>.env</code> file, and you can also do this from the command
line.</p>

<p>Deploy Classic has the

perform a variety of admin tasks, but the new iteration of Deno Deploy brings
things closer to the <code>deno</code> runtime so there is no need to install additional
tools.</p>
<p>Now, just by having the
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno CLI installed</a>,
you’ll have commands like
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/deploy/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>deno deploy</code></a> at your
fingertips which lets you… well… deploy to Deno Deploy among other things.</p>
<p>You can also use this to manage your project’s environment variables and other
configurations, push code to preview builds or the production environment,
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/deploy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">and more</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> You can close the gap between your local and production

</blockquote>
<p>One goal of the recent evolutions to Deno Deploy has been to improve the
development efficiency on projects. A huge part of that can come from reducing
the friction when developing locally, and closing the perceived logical gap
between local and production environments.</p>
<p>In short, please, please let my local work be a good facsimile of what happens
in staging and production environments!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/deno_land/status/1976281146184040625" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>--tunnel</code></a> flag
connects your local environment to your application in Deno Deploy to enable a
few handy things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access the centrally managed environment variable, which eliminates the need
to distribute these to the team in order for them to get their local builds
working</li>
<li>Serve your local version on a public URL for easier sharing, reviewing, and
debugging</li>
<li>Stream logs and traces directly back to your local terminal for easier
observability during development</li>
</ul>
<figure>

  <figcaption>The <code>--tunnel</code> option lets you share a link to your app running locally </figcaption>

<p>The <code>--tunnel</code> option is available to the <code>run</code> and <code>task</code> commands. Over time,
you can expect it to become even more powerful as more utilities are added.</p>
<h2 id="connect-your-apps-to-aws-and-gcp">Connect your apps to AWS and GCP</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Cloud Connect simplifies your code when connecting to different

<p>Often we have to use resources in AWS and GCP, but it can be a pain to manually
juggle credentials and configurations.</p>
<p>With our new
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/reference/cloud-connections/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Connections</a>,
you can configure an
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/reference/oidc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OIDC connection</a> with your

ways the platform can remove friction for developers, and make it easier to
manage and reason about external services.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There have been some big power-ups to playgrounds in their new incarnation.
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/reference/playgrounds/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playgrounds</a> offer an
in-browser code editor which deploys every time you save your changes. Now they
support multiple files, and have become a simple way to explore a concept, test
some code, and inspect the results all without leaving your browser tab.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="http://localhost:3001/blog/deno-deploy-highlights/playground.webp" alt="Playground view">
  <figcaption>Playgrounds have a file explorer and code editor, along with a preview and HTTP explorer</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Playgrounds get built and deployed to Deno Deploy and give you the same logs and
traces as your regular Deno applications, and also provide
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/reference/playgrounds/#using-the-http-explorer" rel="noopener noreferrer">an HTTP explorer</a>
to help you test your projects.</p>
<p>I find it a very handy way to test APIs that I’m experimenting with. The ability
to test different HTTP methods and control HTTP headers from the built-in HTTP
explorer is so useful.</p>
<p>Playgrounds are now moved under the Applications tab in the
<a href="https://console.deno.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">console</a>, and I happen to know that there are more

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>This is just a small sampling of what is available on Deno Deploy. The best way
to get a real feel for how the platform is evolving is to <a href="/deploy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">try it</a>.</p>
<p>Deploying one of the
<a href="#making-it-easier-to-try-deno-deploy">simple starter templates above</a> can be an
easy way to get a little application up and running so you have something to
explore. You can sign up, create an orgnization and some apps, and start
deploying things for free.</p>
<p>There are lots more things coming soon to the platform to help you build,
deploy, and manage your web applications. I’m pretty excited about the
developments happening under the surface to support some great new tools and
ways for you to run code as part of your web stack.</p>
